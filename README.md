# dim-reader

This project is an indirect port of the work that
[@cfogrady](https://github.com/cfogrady) has done in their
[DIM-Modifier](https://github.com/cfogrady/DIM-Modifier) and
[VB-DIM-Reader](https://github.com/cfogrady/VB-DIM-Reader) projects.

The goals of this project are undetermined, but I've currently been
enjoying the process of making DIM Card data viewable in the
browser. This project is helping me build reverse-engineering skills
and may eventually lead to other integrations of the Vital Bracelet
with Apple Watch or other platforms.
